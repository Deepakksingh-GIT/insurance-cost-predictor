# 💊 Medical Insurance Cost Prediction
End-to-end Python project to predict individual medical insurance costs using Machine Learning.  
Includes EDA, data preprocessing, regression models, MLflow tracking, and an interactive Streamlit web app.

## 🩺 Project Overview
This project predicts individual medical insurance costs based on personal and health information such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, and number of dependents.

### Business Use Cases:
- Helps insurance companies determine personalized premiums.
- Assists individuals in planning insurance policies.
- Supports healthcare consultants in estimating out-of-pocket costs.

## 📊 Dataset
Dataset: `medical_insurance.csv`
**Features:**
- `age`: Age of the individual  
- `sex`: Gender (male/female)  
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index  
- `children`: Number of dependents  
- `smoker`: Smoking status (yes/no)  
- `region`: Residential area (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)  
- `charges`: Insurance cost (Target)

## 🚀 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values
   - Encode categorical variables
   - Feature engineering (BMI category, interaction terms)

2. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate analysis
   - Outlier detection
   - Correlation analysis

3. **Model Training**
   - Algorithms used: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM
   - Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R²
   - MLflow used for tracking experiments

4. **Streamlit App**
   - User-friendly interface
   - Accepts user input & predicts insurance cost
   - Visual insights (charts & plots)
  
## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM  
- MLflow  
- Streamlit
